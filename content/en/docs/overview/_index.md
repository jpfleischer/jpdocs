getting rid of tiktok really hurts the music industry
since music goes viral on there

some tips in development:
there is a windows docker bug when making nodejs stuff,
you have to use -L flag for it to actually update

## archiving youtube videos

archive.today / archive.ph is probably not an ideal
choice because there is no way to mirror them, i.e. no
torrent mirror. 

if anything is not able to be mirrored, then it isnt
worth using.

in any case, archive.today cant save comments OR videos:
https://archive.ph/7T138

remember the cached versions that google had back in mid
2010s? google got rid of that

there should be a way, like wayback machine downloader,
to somehow download all of archive.today sites


## tv show transcripts

ai overlook (when you search on google) is really bad
for identifying tv show episodes with certain quotes.

the best way is to do this for example, for bobs burgers

google search
`site:foreverdreaming.org because we're not friends anymore oh gretchen come on`
